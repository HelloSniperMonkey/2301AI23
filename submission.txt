boot_sector1.asm file compiles to a 510 bytes binary file.
qemu load 512 bytes continuasly from the start of the .bin file
but the bin file is only 510 bytes, so the last 2 bytes are random.\

The BIOS uses the last two bytes to identify if the file is a
boot disk, by comparing them to a specif value. Which is false
as the last two bytes are random. So the boot loading process false

The boot_sector2.asm file compiles to a 512 byte file with The
correct last 2 bytes. So the booting process completes succesfully.
